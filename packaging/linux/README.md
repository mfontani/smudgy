# Linux packaging (Flatpak)

Smudgy ships on Linux as a self-distributed **Flatpak bundle** — a single
`smudgy-v<version>-<arch>.flatpak` file (x86_64 and aarch64) a user installs with
`flatpak install --user smudgy-v<version>-<arch>.flatpak`. This is the Linux
counterpart of the Windows Inno Setup installer (`bin/release.ps1`) and the macOS
`.dmg` (`bin/release-mac.sh`).

The app id is **`org.smudgy.Smudgy`** (macOS uses `org.smudgy`, which is only two
components and is not a valid Flatpak/D-Bus id).

## Build

```sh
# One command. Installs the runtimes if missing, builds, and bundles.
bin/release-linux.sh

# Signed (recommended for distribution): embeds the public key so the user's
# `flatpak install` trusts the origin with no manual key import.
SMUDGY_GPG_KEYID=<your-gpg-key-id> bin/release-linux.sh
```

Output: `dist/smudgy-v<version>-<arch>.flatpak`.

Prerequisites: `flatpak` + **network access at build time** (see strategy below).
The build tool (`org.flatpak.Builder`), the freedesktop `25.08` runtimes, and the
`rust-stable` + `llvm20` extensions are installed automatically from Flathub on
first run. Deno 2.9.5's Rust crate family requires Rust 1.95.0 or newer; the
`rust-stable` SDK extension is used deliberately and the manifest prints
`rustc --version` before building so the toolchain is auditable in the build
log — a pre-1.95 SDK fails later during compilation, and the printed version
is how to diagnose it.

### Architectures

The manifest is architecture-agnostic — the `v8` crate downloads the matching
prebuilt for the sandbox arch, and cargo compiles natively. `bin/release-linux.sh`
builds for the host arch by default; pass `--arch` to target another:

```sh
bin/release-linux.sh --arch x86_64     # (default on an x86_64 host)
bin/release-linux.sh --arch aarch64    # ARM64
```

Each arch produces its own `dist/smudgy-v<version>-<arch>.flatpak`.

**Where to build aarch64:** run the command **on a native ARM64 machine or CI
runner** (e.g. a GitHub Actions `ubuntu-*-arm` runner, an ARM cloud VM, or an
Apple-Silicon Linux VM) — it's fast and reliable. Cross-building aarch64 on an
x86_64 host is possible but runs the entire compile in a QEMU-emulated sandbox
(very slow); it needs `qemu-user-static` + registered binfmt so `flatpak
--supported-arches` lists `aarch64`. The script refuses an unsupported arch with a
pointer to both options.

Install and run:

```sh
flatpak install --user dist/smudgy-v<version>-x86_64.flatpak   # unsigned bundles install as-is
flatpak run org.smudgy.Smudgy                                 # launch (works immediately)
```

**Launcher note.** The bundle ships a `.desktop` entry, and installing exports it to
`~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications/`. It appears in the GNOME/Ubuntu
app grid only once that path is in the session's `XDG_DATA_DIRS` — which
`/etc/profile.d/flatpak.sh` sets **at login**. So after a first `--user` install into
a pre-existing session, **log out and back in** to make the app show up in the
launcher. `flatpak run org.smudgy.Smudgy` works right away without that. (Flatpak
apps are never on `$PATH` by their bare name; alias it if you want a `smudgy` command.)

## Releasing (CI)

Pushing a `v<x.y.z>` tag triggers `.github/workflows/flatpak-release.yml`, which
builds both arches on **native** runners (x86_64 + aarch64 — no emulation) and
publishes `smudgy-v<version>-<arch>.flatpak` to the wiki's `download:` media
namespace via `bin/dokuwiki-upload.sh`.

The upload is **SSH/scp**, not the DokuWiki JSON-RPC media API: `core.saveMedia`
carries the file base64-encoded in a JSON body and DokuWiki's PHP `memory_limit`
is exhausted on large binaries (a 38 MB bundle returns HTTP 500). scp drops the
file straight into the media dir, which DokuWiki serves as-is. Required repo
secrets: `SMUDGY_WIKI_SSH` (`user@host`), `SMUDGY_WIKI_MEDIA_DIR` (the server's
DokuWiki `data/media` path), `SMUDGY_WIKI_SSH_KEY` (deploy private key); optional
`SMUDGY_WIKI_SSH_PORT` and `SMUDGY_WIKI_URL` (enables a post-upload download
check). Because scp drops the file straight onto disk, DokuWiki's upload
extension-whitelist doesn't apply — `fetch.php` serves any existing media file —
so no `.flatpak` mime config is needed. The `download:` namespace does need to be
public-readable for anonymous downloads.

**Signing.** Like the Windows (Authenticode) and macOS (Developer ID + notarized)
builds, the Flatpak is GPG-signed: the OSTree commit is signed (so `flatpak
install` verifies the key embedded in the bundle) **and** a detached
`smudgy-v<version>-<arch>.flatpak.asc` is written and uploaded alongside, plus the
armored public key `smudgy-signing-key.asc`. CI imports the key from the
`SMUDGY_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` secret (use a passphrase-less key for automation, or set
`SMUDGY_GPG_PASSPHRASE`); locally, `SMUDGY_GPG_KEYID=<keyid> bin/release-linux.sh`.
Publish the key fingerprint on smudgy.org so users have a trusted reference.

Users verify a download with:

```sh
gpg --import smudgy-signing-key.asc      # once
gpg --verify smudgy-v<version>-<arch>.flatpak.asc smudgy-v<version>-<arch>.flatpak
flatpak install --user smudgy-v<version>-<arch>.flatpak
```

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `org.smudgy.Smudgy.yml` | flatpak-builder manifest |
| `smudgy-wrapper.sh` | launch wrapper — sets `--data-dir` (see *Data* below) |
| `org.smudgy.Smudgy.desktop` | desktop entry (app-menu icon) |
| `org.smudgy.Smudgy.metainfo.xml` | AppStream metadata |
| `org.smudgy.Smudgy.png` / `-512.png` | 256/512 icons (installed to `hicolor`) |

## Design decisions

**Base runtime — `org.freedesktop.Platform//25.08`.** The app is `winit` + `wgpu`
with no GTK, so the lean freedesktop base is correct. The `rust-stable` SDK
extension (rustc 1.96) provides the toolchain; it is build-time only and never
appears in `finish-args`.

**Data location — the host's `~/Documents/smudgy`.** Matches the Windows/macOS
builds and stays user-visible, so it also *shares data with a non-Flatpak install*
on the same machine. `dirs::document_dir()` does not resolve inside the sandbox
(the config dir is redirected to `~/.var/app/...`), so `smudgy-wrapper.sh` passes
the app's `--data-dir` flag explicitly. The manifest grants exactly this subtree —
`--filesystem=xdg-documents/smudgy:create` — **not** the whole Documents tree and
**not** `home`, which keeps the sandbox hole narrow. Inside the sandbox `$HOME` is
still the real home *path* (only `XDG_*_HOME` are redirected), so
`$HOME/Documents/smudgy` is the correct host path.

**Credentials — Secret Service.** The cloud session token and profile passwords
use the OS keyring. On Linux `smudgy_core` enables keyring's `sync-secret-service`
backend, and the manifest grants `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets`. Without a
running secret service the app falls back to its obfuscated-file store.

**DevTools inspector — omitted (v1).** The `smudgy_inspector` sidecar uses
`wry`/WebKitGTK, which the freedesktop runtime does not ship. Its launch degrades
gracefully (logged, non-fatal), so it is left out. To ship it, switch the base to
`org.gnome.Platform` (bundles WebKitGTK) and build+install the sidecar too.

**Window icon.** `smudgy_ui` sets the iced window `application_id` to
`org.smudgy.Smudgy` on Linux, so the running window associates with the desktop
file (Wayland `app_id` / X11 `WM_CLASS`) and shows the app icon.

## Build strategy: network-enabled (current) vs offline/vendored

The manifest grants the **build module** `--share=network` so `cargo` fetches
crates and — importantly — the `v8` crate downloads its prebuilt `librusty_v8`
static archive from GitHub. This is the simplest correct path for a private,
non-Flathub bundle. It is **not** bit-reproducible and is not Flathub-eligible
(Flathub forbids build-time network).

To go **fully offline** later (reproducible / Flathub):

1. Vendor the cargo registry. From `flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools`:
   `python3 cargo/flatpak-cargo-generator.py Cargo.lock -o packaging/linux/cargo-sources.json`
   (regenerate whenever `Cargo.lock` changes; it ignores path/workspace deps and
   the vendored `iced_tiny_skia` `[patch.crates-io]`).
2. Pre-fetch the `librusty_v8` prebuilt as manifest `sources` and point the build
   at it. The Deno 2.9.5 engine chain is `deno_core 0.410 -> deno_v8 0.2 ->
   v8 150.4.0`; `deno_v8` enables the V8 backend with `simdutf`, so the assets are
   the `_simdutf_` variants for that pinned rusty_v8 release
   (`librusty_v8_simdutf_release_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.a.gz` +
   `src_binding_simdutf_release_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.rs` from the matching
   `denoland/rusty_v8` release). Set `RUSTY_V8_ARCHIVE` and
   `RUSTY_V8_SRC_BINDING_PATH` (absolute); never set `V8_FROM_SOURCE`.
   Re-check the suffix with `cargo tree -e features -i deno_v8` and
   `cargo tree -i v8@150.4.0` after any dependency bump. The experimental
   `quickjs`/`v8x` backend must remain inactive.
3. Drop the module's `build-args: [--share=network]` and build with
   `cargo build --profile release-full --offline`.

## Sandbox permissions (`finish-args`)

| Arg | Why |
|-----|-----|
| `--share=network` | MUD TCP, cloud/package HTTPS, `jsr:`/`npm:` script imports |
| `--share=ipc` | X11 SHM (render perf); harmless on Wayland |
| `--socket=wayland` + `--socket=fallback-x11` | display |
| `--device=dri` | GPU for `wgpu` (Vulkan/GL); not `all` |
| `--filesystem=xdg-documents/smudgy:create` | data dir (scoped, see above) |
| `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets` | OS keyring (Secret Service is not a portal) |

URLs and the data folder open through the OpenURI/OpenDirectory portals, which
need no extra grant. V8/`deno_core` JIT runs under the default seccomp filter (no
`--allow=devel`).
